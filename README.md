# Ivanti VPN Detection Scanner

This script scans IP addresses for signs of exposed **Ivanti Secure Access VPN** (formerly Pulse Secure) appliances by:

1. Performing TLS JA3 fingerprinting with `zgrab2`
2. Matching against known Ivanti JA3 hashes
3. Probing likely endpoints with `nuclei`
4. Capturing screenshots and metadata using `httpx`
5. Generating a Markdown report
